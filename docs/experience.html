						<h2>Experience</h2>
						<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 85px;">There are projects which, I think, the most complicated and serious. But I have many more projects in my life.
						For example, I made a Rubik's cube with OpenGL, or a simple messager, using Flask. You can see all my works in my Github.

								<p align="center">This project is about collecting cards, which probably all of us collected in the childhood.
								This is an Android app, which helps to monitor your collection, you can comfortable see which cards you don't have.
								You can read more about this project in README in my <a href="https://github.com/Ulyana75/CollectionApp" target="_blank">repository on Github</a>.
								Also, you can download this app there.</p>

								<img class="gallery_image" src="../resources/track_project.jpg" width="200"/>
								<p align="center">Sometimes you hear about interesting movie and you want to watch it in the future.
								My app helps you to write down movie's names, also here you can evaluate movies, which you like and which you don't like.
								It is not only for movies - you can do the same with games, books and series.
								You can read more about this project in README in my <a href="https://github.com/Ulyana75/TrackMyMedia" target="_blank">repository on Github</a>.
								Also, you can download this app there.</p>

								<img class="gallery_image" src="../resources/find_project.jpg" width="200"/>
								<p align="center">This project was one of the hardest for me. This app was written on the Hackaton during two days.
								It sends phone metrics and location on background (even if app was closed). I learned how to work with services thanks to this project.
								Also, it uses retrofit to send data to backend. Our team won this hackaton. You can read more about this project in README 
								in my <a href="https://github.com/Ulyana75/findMyPhone" target="_blank">repository on Github</a>.</p>

								<img class="gallery_image" src="../resources/movies_project.jpg" width="200"/>
								<p align="center">This app I wrote during the MTS summer school. This app is about popular movies, which are taken from TMDB. 
								It doesn't works good yet, but it looks beautiful. I used a lot of technologies here. For example, Room, Retrofit, Worker, animations, 
								MVVM pattern, and other. In the neraest future I plan to improve the functionality of this app. 
								But now it can help to monitore popular movies and read some information about them. You can see the code in my
								<a href="https://github.com/Ulyana75/mts-summer-school-homework" target="_blank">repository on Github</a></p>
